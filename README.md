# ARES

ARES (Agentic Research and Evaluation Suite) is an RL-first framework for training and evaluating agents.

## Installation

We recommend using ARES with uv. Simply:

`uv sync --all-groups`

and you're ready to get started.


## Getting Started

TODO(Josh): Add a basic code snippet once interfaces have been updated.
