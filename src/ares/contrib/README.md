# ARES: Contrib

Contributed components for ARES (experimental, no API stability guarantees).

ARES provides a consistent interface to tasks, not algorithms. However, we offer some
simple reusable components to help users get started quickly.

WARNING: These are convenience utilities, not core ARES components. Interfaces may
change or be removed in future versions without deprecation warnings. For production
use, consider implementing your own components following the ARES protocols.
